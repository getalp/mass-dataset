						   1 Corinthians 13        1    If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.         2    And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.         3    If I give away all I have, and if I deliver up my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing.         4    Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant         5    or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful;         6    it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth.         7    Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.         8    Love never ends. As for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away.         9    For we know in part and we prophesy in part,         10    but when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away.         11    When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I gave up childish ways.         12    For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known.         13    So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love.
